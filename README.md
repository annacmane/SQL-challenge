# SQL-challenge

# Background
## I am the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). As the data engineer, my first task is to research the people who were emplyed at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. There are six CSV files that contain information about these employees.

# Objectives
## This research project consists of designing the tables the 6 CSV files will be living in and creating an ERD that will map how the tables will be connected and referenced to each other and pulling information from these 6 CSV files to showcase a table containing information we are looking for. The task will include:
##      1. Data Modeling
##      2. Data Engineering
##      3. Data Analysis

# Data Modeling
## After inspecting each CSV file, below is a sketch of the Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD


## Please follow the instructions below to execute the code in this repository:

## 1.Clone this repository into your local

## 2. On SQL, create a database named "employeeSQL" and open a query tool for this database

## 3. In SQL-challenge, open file employees_schemas.sql and copy the code inside and paste into your query tool from step 2. Run this code

## 4. You MUST import the files in SQL-challenge/data in the order that the tables were created:
##     1. titles
##     2. employees
##     3. departments
##     4. dept_emp
##     5. dept_managers
##     6. salaries
## To do so, in postgreSQL, locate the folder "Tables" in database employeesSQL/Schemas/Tables and right clicking the table names in the order as shown above, clicking "Import/Export Data..." and attaching the corresponding file from SQL-challenge/data -->

## 5. Open a new query tool.

## 6. In SQL-challenge, open file employees_queries.sql and
